Oracle JDBC Drivers release 11.2.0.1.0 production Readme.txt
==========================================================


What Is New In This Release ?
-----------------------------

Universal Connection Pool
    In this release the Oracle Implicit Connection Cache feature is
    deprecated. Users are strongly encouraged to use the new Universal
    Connection Pool instead. The UCP has all of the features of the
    ICC, plus much more. The UCP is available in a separate jar file,
    ucp.jar. 

Column Security
    When a table is XDS (eXtensible Data Security) enabled, some
    objects (or rows) may be invisible to the user depending on the
    security constraints. Moreover, an object (or row) can be visible
    but some of its attributes (or columns) may not be. Starting in
    11gR2, the JDBC drivers support these new security attributes and
    let you determine whether a particular column has some security
    attributes and whether a column value is null because it's hidden
    or because it's actually null. 

Secure Lob
    Additional support for the Oracle Database 11.1 Secure LOB feature.

Lob prefetch
    Improves the performance of some LOB read operations by fetching
    the initial bytes or chars of the LOB along with the locator. For
    very small LOBs, less than a few thousand bytes, the entire LOB
    value may be fetched. This improves the performance of reads on
    very small lobs and reads of the initial bytes or chars on all
    LOBS. 

Network Connection Pool
    The network connection pool allows multiple java.sql.Connection
    objects to share a limited number of network level channels. Each
    Connection is associated with a single database session. The
    Connection object communicates with the session over a network
    channel. When the network connection pool is enabled, network
    channels are shared among multiple Connection/session pairs. In
    some situations this can reduce the resources consumed on both the
    client and server and improve performance and scalability.

XMLType Queue Support in AQ
    Oracle Database 11gR1 JDBC introduced high performance access to
    Oracle Advanced Queueing. This release extends this support by
    providing high performance access to queues that use SQL XMLType.

Notification Grouping in AQ and DCN
    Notification Grouping is a new feature of JDBC Notification which
    was included in Database 11gR1 and which includes AQ Notification
    as well as Database Change Notification. You can now ask the
    database to group notifications for example every 60 seconds. When
    using Notification Grouping, you are given the option to either
    get only the last notification or a summary of them.

TimeZone Patching
    Improved support for time zones that are not directly supported by
    the client Java environment.

Reduced Memory Footprint
    In 10gR1 we rearchitected the drivers to improve performance at
    the cost of increasing memory footprint, especially when using the
    (highly recommended!) statement cache. We achieved our goal of
    improving performance, but the increase in memory footprint has
    sometimes proved problematic. The 11gR1 release retained the
    performance improvements and reduced the memory footprint for
    most users. The 11gR2 release provides some tuning options for
    that subset of users that need them. This is users with large
    numbers of connections and large statement caches. See the JavaDoc
    for oracle.jdbc.OracleConnection.CONNECTION_PROPERTY_USE_THREADLOCAL_BUFFER_CACHE 
    and CONNECTION_PROPERTY_MAX_CACHED_BUFFER_SIZE for details. Don't
    worry about this unless you are running out of heap.

Contents Of This Release
------------------------

For all platforms:

  [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/lib contains:

  - ojdbc5.jar
    Classes for use with JDK 1.5.  It contains the JDBC driver
    classes, except classes for NLS support in Oracle Object and
    Collection types.

  - ojdbc5_g.jar
    Same as ojdbc5.jar, except that classes were compiled with
    "javac -g" and contain tracing code.

  - ojdbc5dms.jar
    Same as ojdbc5.jar, except that it contains instrumentation to
    support DMS and limited java.util.logging calls.

  - ojdbc5dms_g.jar
    Same as ojdbc5_g.jar, except that it contains instrumentation to
    support DMS.

  - ojdbc6.jar
    Classes for use with JDK 1.6. It contains the JDBC driver classes
    except classes for NLS support in Oracle Object and Collection
    types. 

  - ojdbc6_g.jar
    Same as ojdbc6.jar except compiled with "javac -g" and contains
    tracing code.

  - ojdbc6dms.jar
    Same as ojdbc6.jar, except that it contains instrumentation to
    support DMS and limited java.util.logging calls.

  - ojdbc6dms_g.jar
    Same as ojdbc6_g.jar except that it contains instrumentation to
    support DMS.

  Note: The dms versions of the jar files are the same as 
    standard jar files, except that they contain additional code
    to support Oracle Dynamic Monitoring Service. They contain a
    limited amount of tracing code. These can only be used
    when dms.jar is in the classpath. dms.jar is provided as part of
    Oracle Application Server releases. As a result the dms versions
    of the jar files can only be used in an Oracle Application Server
    environment. 

  [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/doc/javadoc.tar contains the JDBC Javadoc
  for the public API of the public classes of Oracle JDBC. This
  JavaDoc is the primary reference for Oracle JDBC API extensions. The
  Oracle JDBC Development Guide contains high level discussion of
  Oracle extensions. The details are in this JavaDoc. The JavaDoc is
  every bit as authorative as the Dev Guide.

  [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/demo/demo.tar contains sample JDBC programs.

  [ORACLE_HOME]/jlib/orai18n.jar
    NLS classes for use with JDK 1.5, and 1.6.  It contains
    classes for NLS support in Oracle Object and Collection types.
    This jar file replaces the old nls_charset jar/zip files. In 
    Oracle 10g R1 it was duplicated in [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/lib. We
    have removed the duplicate copy and you should now get it from
    its proper location.


For the Windows platform:

  [ORACLE_HOME]\bin directory contains ocijdbc11.dll and
  heteroxa11.dll, which are the libraries used by the JDBC OCI
  driver.

For non-Windows platforms:

  [ORACLE_HOME]/lib directory contains libocijdbc11.so,
  libocijdbc11_g.so, libheteroxa11.so and libheteroxa11_g.so, which
  are the shared libraries used by the JDBC OCI driver.


NLS Extension Jar File (for client-side only)
---------------------------------------------

The JDBC Server-side Internal Driver provides complete NLS support.
It does not require any NLS extension jar file.  Discussions in this
section only apply to the Oracle JDBC Thin and JDBC OCI drivers.

The basic jar files (ojdbc5.jar and ojdbc6.jar) contain all the
necessary classes to provide complete NLS support for:

  - Oracle Character sets for CHAR/VARCHAR/LONGVARCHAR/CLOB type data
    that is not retrieved or inserted as a data member of an Oracle
    Object or Collection type.

  - NLS support for CHAR/VARCHAR data members of Objects and
    Collections for a few commonly used character sets.  These
    character sets are:  US7ASCII, WE8DEC, WE8ISO8859P1, WE8MSWIN1252,
    and UTF8.

Users must include the NLS extension jar file
([ORACLE_HOME]/jlib/orai18n.jar) in their CLASSPATH if utilization of
other character sets in CHAR/VARCHAR data members of
Objects/Collections is desired.  The new orai18n.jar replaces the
nls_charset*.* files in the 9i and older releases.

The file orai18n.jar contains many important character-related files.
Most of these files are essential to globalization support.  Instead
of extracting only the character-set files your application uses, it
is safest to follow this three-step process: 1.  Unpack orai18n.jar
into a temporary directory.  2.  Delete the character-set files that
your application does not use.  Do not delete any territory, collation
sequence, or mapping files.  3.  Create a new orai18n.jar file from
the temporary directory and add the altered file to your CLASSPATH.
See the JDBC Developers Guide for more information.

In addition, users can also include internationalized Jdbc error
message files selectively.  The message files are included in the
oracle/jdbc/driver/Messages_*.properties files in ojdbc5*.jar and
ojdbc6*.jar. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Installation

    use JDK 1.5 or [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/lib/ojdbc6.jar if you use JDK 1.6
  - Add [ORACLE_HOME]/jlib/orai18n.jar to your CLASSPATH if needed.
  - Add [ORACLE_HOME]/jdbc/lib to your LIBPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    if you use the JDBC OCI driver.


Some Useful Hints In Using the JDBC Drivers
-------------------------------------------

Please refer to "JDBC Developer's Guide and Reference" for details
regarding usage of Oracle's JDBC Drivers.  This section only offers
useful hints.  These hints are not meant to be exhaustive.

These are a few simple things that you should do in your JDBC program:

 1. Import the necessary JDBC classes in your programs that use JDBC.
    For example:

      import java.sql.*;
      import java.math.*; // if needed

    To use OracleDataSource, you need to do:
      import oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource;

 2. Create an OracleDataSource instance. 

      OracleDataSource ods = new OracleDataSource();

 3. set the desired properties if you don't want to use the
    default properties. Different connection URLs should be
    used for different JDBC drivers.

      ods.setUser("my_user");
      ods.setPassword("my_password");

    For the JDBC OCI Driver:
      To make a bequeath connection, set URL as:
      ods.setURL("jdbc:oracle:oci:@");

      To make a remote connection, set URL as:
      ods.setURL("jdbc:oracle:oci:@<database>");

      where <database> is either a TNSEntryName 
      or a SQL*net name-value pair defined in tnsnames.ora.
 
    For the JDBC Thin Driver, or Server-side Thin Driver:
      ods.setURL("jdbc:oracle:thin:@<database>");

      where <database> is either a string of the form
      //<host>:<port>/<service_name>, or a SQL*net name-value pair,
      or a TNSEntryName.

    For the JDBC Server-side Internal Driver:
      ods.setURL("jdbc:oracle:kprb:");

      Note that the trailing ':' is necessary. When you use the 
      Server-side Internal Driver, you always connect to the
      database you are executing in. You can also do this:

      Connection conn =
        new oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver().defaultConnection();

 4. Open a connection to the database with getConnection()
    methods defined in OracleDataSource class.

      Connection conn = ods.getConnection();

BUG-7304027
    Consistent behavior of getBoolean.

BUG-7288889
    Driver does not store the correct internal data buffer sizes. This
    can be a problem in low memory conditions as the driver can
    attempt to use buffers that are larger than would otherwise be
    necessary. Is not a problem except when in very low memory
    conditions. Fix also add a new connection property
    oracle.jdbc.maxCachedBufferSize which limits the size of the data
    buffers that are cached for reuse. It is better to manage the data
    buffer size by setting fetch size appropriately for each
    statement, but if that is not feasible, setting
    maxCachedBufferSize can reduce memory footprint at the expense of
    reduced performance for statements that require buffers larger
    than the max.

    user code will have to be changed. This will happen when the user

    Binding a Time value to the database in an insert used to set the
    Date component as 01-Jan-1900 in 9i since, the method
    java.sql.Time().getTime() does not trim the date component.
    However, during re-architecture of Jdbc in 10g this behavior was
    changed and the date component was not reset.   This
    caused a regression for 9i customers .  Resetting the value to
    01-Jan-1900 by default would cause a regression for the 10g users
    who have been using the flag for over 4 years until now.  So a new
    connection flag oracle.jdbc.use1900AsYearForTime was introduced
    which would force the driver to set the date component in the Time
    to 01-Jan-1900.   The default value of this flag is
    false.

Known Problems/Limitations In This Release
------------------------------------------

The following is a list of known problems/limitations:

 *  Calling getSTRUCT() on ADT data in a ScrollableResultSet may
    result in a NullpointerException.

 *  Programs can fail to open 16 or more connections using our
    client-side drivers at any one time.  This is not a limitation 
    caused by the JDBC drivers.  It is most likely that the limit of
    per-process file descriptors is exceeded.  The solution is to 
    increase the limit. 

 *  The Server-side Internal Driver has the following limitation:
    - LONG and LONG RAW types are limited 32512 bytes for parameters
      of PL/SQL procedures. BUG-5965340
    - In a chain of SQLExceptions, only the first one in the chain
      will have a getSQLState value.
    - Batch updates with Oracle 8 Object, REF and Collection data
      types are not supported.

 *  The JDBC OCI driver on an SSL connection hangs when the Java
    Virtual Machine is running in green threads mode.  A work-around
    is to run the Java Virtual Machine in native threads mode.

 *  Date-time format, currency symbol and decimal symbols are always
    presented in American convention.

 *  The utility dbms_java.set_output or dbms_java.set_stream that is
    used for redirecting the System.out.println() in JSPs to stdout
    SHOULD NOT be used when JDBC tracing is turned on.  This is
    because the current implementation of dbms_java.set_output and
    set_stream uses JDBC to write the output to stdout.  The result
    would be an infinite loop.

 *  The JDBC OCI and Thin drivers do not read CHAR data via binary
    streams correctly.  In other word, using getBinaryStream() to
    retrieve CHAR data may yield incorrect results.  A work-around is
    to use either getCHAR() or getAsciiStream() instead.  The other
    alternative is to use getUnicodeStream() although the method is
    deprecated.

 *   There is a limitation for Triggers implemented in Java and Object
     Types. Triggers implemented as Java methods cannot have OUT
     arguments of Oracle 8 Object or Collection type.  This means the
     Java methods used to implement triggers cannot have arguments
     of the following types:

    - java.sql.Struct
    - java.sql.Array
    - oracle.sql.STRUCT
    - oracle.sql.ARRAY
    - oracle.jdbc2.Struct
    - oracle.jdbc2.Array
    - any class implementing oracle.jdbc2.SQLData or
      oracle.sql.CustomDatum

 *  The scrollable result set implementation has the following
    limitation:

    - setFetchDirection() on ScrollableResultSet does not do anything.
    - refreshRow() on ScrollableResultSet does not support all
      combinations of sensitivity and concurrency.  The following
      table depicts the supported combinations.

        Support     Type                       Concurrency
        -------------------------------------------------------
        no          TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY          CONCUR_READ_ONLY
        no          TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY          CONCUR_UPDATABLE
        no          TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE    CONCUR_READ_ONLY
        yes         TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE    CONCUR_UPDATABLE
        yes         TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE      CONCUR_READ_ONLY
        yes         TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE      CONCUR_UPDATABLE

 *  Limitation on using PreparedStatements to create triggers. Since
    :foo is recognized by the drivers as a SQL parameter, it is not
    possible to use :in and :out in SQL that defines a trigger when
    using a PreparedStatement. The workaround is to use a Statement
    instead.
